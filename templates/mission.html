            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5%;">My name is Mateo Weeks, and I am a Junior at Pope High School. I am contacting you because I found your work with East Cobber very interesting. I also noticed you have an extensive outreach with the East Cobb community and have covered similar stories recently. A few years ago, my younger cousin suddenly passed away due to a brain aneurysm at just eleven years old. As I witnessed his death take a toll on his parents and brothers, I was still in shock since I had never heard of such an illness before. I began to do more research, and the results were astounding. Brain aneurysms are one of the least studied phenomena in the medical world. In fact, the federal government only spends two dollars per year on research per person afflicted. This inspired me to found Tutors Beat Tumors Non-profit, student-led corporation. Our goal is to raise money and awareness of brain tumors and aneurysms by offering affordable tutoring to East Cobb students. I know it is a lot to ask from someone you have never met before, but if I could write a story for you to include in your newsletter or website, it would greatly help our cause. If you would like to meet to talk things over, I would love to do so.</h3>
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 5%;">A few years ago, my younger cousin suddenly passed away due to a brain aneurysm at just eleven years old. As I witnessed his death take a toll on his parents and brothers, I was still in shock since I had never heard of such an illness before. I began to do more research, and the results were astounding. Brain aneurysms are one of the least studied phenomena in the medical world. In fact, the federal government only spends two dollars per year on research per person afflicted. Seeing this, I decided to start our organization. We obtained an EIN of 92-1531253 and recently filed for proof of existence to gain 501C3 status. Although we are a student-led organization, we adhere to strict bylaws and a conflict-of-interest policy. We offer individual tutoring outside school or group tutoring in elementary schools.</h3>
            <h2>Our Tutors</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10%;">Our tutors are hand selected for the subjects they teach and have a top 10% GPA requirement. We have tutors in all Elementary/Middle school Math, Science, Reading, English, Social Studies, as well as most high school subjects including SAT. 100% of the proceeds are donated to https://www.bafound.org/.
